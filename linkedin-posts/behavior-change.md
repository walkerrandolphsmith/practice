ðŸ’¡ Some code and system changes are clearly the right move.
Better performance. More secure. Less risk.
But thereâ€™s a catch: they require behavior change.

You canâ€™t force these shifts. You have to lead them.

Hereâ€™s whatâ€™s worked for me:

ðŸ”¹ Build trust with small wins before asking for big shifts
ðŸ”¹ Paint the long-term vision, not just the short-term gain
ðŸ”¹ Show successâ€”donâ€™t just talk theory
ðŸ”¹ Break change into small, frictionless steps
ðŸ”¹ Meet hesitation with curiosity, not pressure
ðŸ”¹ Celebrate progress, not perfection

Technical wins donâ€™t stick without social buy-in. Build that first.
