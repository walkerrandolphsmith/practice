There’s a subtle, often-missed difference in system design:

Overengineering: Solving for a scenario we might face, with rigid assumptions and complex abstractions that add drag today.

Strategic foresight: Designing with just enough flexibility so we aren't boxed in when an expected future scenario arrives.

🔮 We don't have a crystal ball. Even “known” futures can shift. That’s why we build seams and not scaffolding. Flexibility is the hedge.

🎯 The goal is not to build tomorrow’s solution today but to make sure today’s solution doesn’t get in the way of solving tomorrow’s problem
