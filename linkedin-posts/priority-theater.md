🔍 The Hidden Cost of Prioritization Theater in Product Delivery

Are your epics and features beautifully organized on paper, but your unparented backlog of stories looks like chaos?

It’s a common pattern.

Teams often stack-rank features and order stories within them. But flatten that structure, and suddenly the priorities blur…
👉 Is every task in the top feature more valuable than the most critical task in the second feature?

Spoiler: Probably not.

Worse still, in many organizations, feature teams are assigned in parallel. This can create the illusion of progress while de-prioritizing what actually matters most to the business. The prioritization becomes local instead of global.

I've seen features labeled “v2,” “v3,” and so on—not as true iterations, but because the team skipped slicing work into meaningful increments. The feature stops being a releasable unit of value and instead becomes a container for everything that must ship together to make sense. Value gets locked behind coordination instead of flowing continuously.

That raises a key question: Is a feature a releasable slice of value, or just a thematic bucket for loosely related work? And more importantly, does your backlog blur the line between the two?

Even more concerning, some organizations reinforce this pattern to create leadership opportunities. Senior engineers are assigned features to “own,” not because it’s the most critical work, but because it's structured to support career growth.

Engineering managers then face a quiet tension:
➡️ Push work to match people’s development plans
➡️ Or prioritize based on business impact

Great leaders try to balance both. But we shouldn’t pretend the tradeoff doesn’t exist.

🚧 When our structures obscure value, even well-intentioned teams can end up optimizing for motion, not impact

Transparency is a leadership responsibility.
Your story hierarchy should reflect how value flows, not just how your teams are staffed.
