💬 Many folks talk about how to give better code reviews. Use “nit,” be kind, focus on the code, not the coder.
But what about getting better at taking feedback?

Here’s what I’ve learned (and keep learning):
1. It’s not personal. Ever.
2. Don’t dismiss. If you disagree or think it’s out of scope, say why and track it.
3. Agree in theory, not in practice? Explain the tradeoff.
4. If a “nit” comes up a lot, codify it. Save everyone time.
5. Say thanks. Reviewers are investing in your growth.

Code review is a team sport. The better we get at receiving feedback, the better the whole team gets.

Shout out to Andrew Smith for giving the best code review feedback and Hepcibha Addakula for helping me grow and level up at giving and receiving feedback!
