Check out how I used hashtag#Plausible to get behavioral analytics for my portfolio site. I used Azure Kubernetes with Nginx controller to expose the cluster to Azure Front Door and enabled end to end encryption with automatically rotated TLS certs using cert manager. DNS acme challenges that leveraged 100% secret-less updates to the DNS Zone. 

ðŸ˜… A bit much for a portfolio site, but very fun journey
