🚫🔑 Secretless Infrastructure with Azure Workload Identity Federation 🔒🟢

I have eliminated all static secrets from my stack across CI pipelines, app configurations, and infrastructure provisioning. The result is a fully secretless architecture using Azure Workload Identity Federation and Managed Identities.

Here is what that looks like:

🟢 CI/CD without Secrets
Using federated credentials and user-assigned managed identities on custom Azure agent pools, Terraform runs without needing any client secrets or stored credentials.
If you do not manage your own agent pool, Workload Identity Federation works with Azure DevOps service connections, enabling secure deployments without hardcoded secrets.

🟢 Applications Authenticate via Identity
Apps use DefaultAzureCredential to authenticate using their managed identity and securely access services like App Configuration, Key Vault, and Storage. No connection strings or injected credentials required.

🟢 No Secrets to Leak, Rotate, or Expire
By removing secrets entirely, there is nothing to leak into logs or repos, nothing to rotate, and nothing to expire unexpectedly. Authentication is handled entirely through Azure AD.

🟢 Cleaner Compliance and Simpler Governance
Identity-based access makes it easier to audit and govern usage. Authorization is centralized and policy-driven.

🟢 Scalable and Maintainable
As teams grow and systems become more complex, this model reduces operational overhead and minimizes risk.

If your pipelines or apps still rely on secrets, this is worth exploring. Workload Identity Federation and Managed Identity are mature enough today to support end-to-end identity-based auth across your stack.
