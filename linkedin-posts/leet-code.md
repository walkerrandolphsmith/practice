Still grinding LeetCode after landing the job?
Not because I'll have to.
Not because it’s “fun.” 😅 
Not even because I think it’s a perfect measure of engineering skill.

But because I know sharp minds get dull fast.

Yeah, I’ve heard all the takes:
 “It’s a broken hiring signal.”
 “It’s nothing like real-world engineering.”
 “I haven’t opened LeetCode in years and I’m doing just fine.”

Cool. But when that next opportunity hits—or that systems question comes out of nowhere in a perf review—I’d rather be ready than right. 🔥 


> Hot takes welcome. I'll lean in.
