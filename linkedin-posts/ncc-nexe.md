Hereâ€™s when bundling your entire Node.js app into a single executable (with ncc or nexe) saves the day:

âœ… Service Fabric: Hitting silent file count limits from deep node_modules? Bundle to a single .exe and avoid it completely. Faster deployments, fewer failures.

âœ… Remote Deployments: Copying to a remote server takes 30+ minutes? Bundle your app and Node runtime into one fileâ€”cut transfer time to 10 seconds.

ðŸ‘‰ Yes, Docker is great. But not every target environment supports containers. Sometimes youâ€™re stuck with legacy infra or odd deployment contracts. When that happens, bundling > copying thousands of files.

Sometimes boring problems need sharp solutions.
