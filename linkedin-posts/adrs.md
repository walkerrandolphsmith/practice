💡 ADR: From “Heavy Process” to High-Leverage Tool

Early in my career, I scoffed at Architectural Decision Records. They felt like unnecessary ceremony — too heavy, too process focused, not lean.

But years (and many repeated discussions) later, I’ve completely flipped.

Revisiting the same architectural decisions over and over. Re-explaining the why behind a technical choice to new teammates or across teams. Realizing that context is scattered across Slack, Notion, email, and memory. That’s not lean. That’s waste.

ADRs are the opposite of waste.

They capture:
📌 What did we decide?
🔍 What options did we consider?
📝 Why did we land here?

They can be lightweight markdown files, stored alongside the code, or captured in any format that’s easy to write, read, and find. The key is clarity and permanence.

When done well, they invite peer review, spark productive conversation, and help scale decision-making across time and teams.

This is low-effort, high-leverage documentation that pays off. If your team isn’t using ADRs yet, I’d recommend giving them another look — especially if you think you’re too agile for them.
