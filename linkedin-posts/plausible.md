ðŸ“Š Just added analytics to my personal site, and here's why I'm sharing it early.
I recently integrated Plausible Analytics to start tracking what people engage with. Itâ€™s still early. Not much traffic yet, and no real insights to speak of â€” but thatâ€™s kind of the point. I want to build with feedback, not in a vacuum.

If youâ€™re a creator, engineer, or indie builder:
 ðŸ‘‰ What are you learning from your own analytics?
 ðŸ‘‰ How do you decide what content or projects are worth pursuing?

I'd love to hear how you're thinking about growth, curiosity, and the signals that help guide you.
