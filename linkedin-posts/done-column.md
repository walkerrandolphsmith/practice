🚩 When “Done” is a Lie: Why Our Delivery Boards Fail to Tell the True Story of Value

Is your “Done” column really done?

🔹Merged code sitting idle in main?
🔹Features deployed but hidden behind feature flags?
🔹Releases limited to small user segments, not your full audience?

If your delivery board can’t communicate the real impact your team delivers, it’s failing its most important job: telling the story of value.

This is more than a semantics problem, it’s a visibility problem. It’s about how product, engineering, and leadership align on what “value delivered” means.

So what can we try?

1️⃣ Redefine “Done” as “Value Delivered.” Make your board reflect true customer impact, not just engineering milestones.
2️⃣ Add stages to your workflow: Merged → Deployed → Released → Validated with real user impact.
3️⃣ Integrate release metrics and customer feedback into your delivery narrative. It’s not just about shipping—it’s about shipping value.
4️⃣ Educate stakeholders on why feature flags, dark launches, and phased rollouts matter—and how they affect the “Done” story.

I challenge leaders and teams to rethink their delivery boards. Let’s shift from ticking off tasks to telling the story of impact.
