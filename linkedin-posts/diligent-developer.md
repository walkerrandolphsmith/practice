Some of the engineers I respect most aren’t the ones reaching for the newest tool or framework.

They don’t jump straight to tech solutions.
They’re grounded, patient, and methodical.

They look closely at the real pain points. Bottlenecks, flaky processes, operational friction and work through them one step at a time.

Sometimes the fix is a small script.
Sometimes it’s a process change.
Sometimes it’s just asking a better question.

It’s not flashy, but it moves teams forward in ways that last.
