# Practice

This project demonstrates various programming concepts in isolation. The top-level directories can be thought of as lessons.
Nothing here is production-ready. Everything is experimental and meant for me to learn. Check out the [wiki](https://github.com/walkerrandolphsmith/practice/wiki) for more details. Check out the [roadmap](https://github.com/walkerrandolphsmith/practice/projects/1) to see what topics are being considered.

## Guide

Each directory is prefixed with a number (pending completion) to indicate the order in which the lesson should be consumed. Some concepts build on one another.

## Dependencies

Each lesson will indicate if there is any software that needs to be installed. Generally, we only need Docker and Minikube.

## Linting

```
docker-compose up
```
