# Practice

This project demonstrates various programming concepts in isolation. The top-level directories can be thought of as lessons.
Nothing here is production-ready. Everything is experimental and meant for me to learn. Topics will be added as [issues](https://github.com/walkerrandolphsmith/practice/issues) and added to the kanban board for planning. Check out the [roadmap](https://github.com/walkerrandolphsmith/practice/projects/1) to see what topics will be worked on next.

## Community

We will rely on github's best practices for [building a strong community][community]. Please refer to the `.github` directory for [code of conduct][coc], [contributing guidelines][contributing] and [support][support].

## Guide

Each directory is prefixed with a number (pending completion) to indicate the order in which the lesson should be consumed. Some concepts build on one another.

## Dependencies

Each lesson will indicate if there is any software that needs to be installed. Generally, we only need Docker and Minikube.

## Linting

```
docker-compose up
```
