# Practice

Each top level directory in the repository is numbered and represents a lesson. Each lesson should demonstrate a programming concept. I will demonstrate the concept in isolation, but like most things we will rely on what we have learned in the previous lessons to better understand the motivations and necessities of any given concept. If you have any issues understanind the lesson please refer to our [support][support] materials. If you have found an grammatical issue, coding error, or other technical issue please refer to the [contributing guidelines][contributing]. Topics will be added as [issues](https://github.com/walkerrandolphsmith/practice/issues) and added to the kanban board for planning. Check out the [roadmap](https://github.com/walkerrandolphsmith/practice/projects/1) to see what topics will be worked on next.  
**Disclaimer** Nothing here is hardened or production-ready. Everything is experimental and meant for me to learn.

## Community

We will rely on github's best practices for [building a strong community][community]. Please refer to the `.github` directory for [code of conduct][coc], [contributing guidelines][contributing] and [support][support].

## Sponsorship
I am excited to contribute what I have learned by demonstrating programming concepts in isolation to combat the paywall barrier that many developers hit early in their software craftsmanship journey. I plan on leveraging this sponsorship program to crowdsource funding from community members who are most capable of monetarily contributing while continuing to provide high-quality content and support to those members who are less capable of monetarily contributing. If my mission resonates with you please consider becoming a [sponsor][sponsor]!

> **Goal:**
Obtain 5 sponsors within the first year of providing lessons. I hope the number of sponsors will reflect a small percentage of the number of people who can gain value from these lessons.
