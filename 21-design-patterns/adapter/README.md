# Adapter Pattern

Allows objects with incompatible interfaces to collaborate.

Adapters are all around us. Consider the following examples:

- Using an E12 to E26 converter so a candle bulb light fits in a standard socket.
- Using an electrical adapter to charge a device with an American power cable in a European outlet.
- When you plug your USB cable into a power adapter plugged in the wall to charge your phone.
- When you mount your TV using a vesa mount. The screw holes in the TV don't always align with the frame of the mount without the adjustable brackets.
