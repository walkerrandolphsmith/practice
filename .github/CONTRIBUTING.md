# Contributing

When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via issue, email, or any other method with the owners of this repository before making a change.

Please note we have a [Code of Conduct][coc], please follow it in all your interactions with the project.

## Reporting Issues

Issues are used to capture programming concepts that will be demonstrated with "lessons". Issues with the label `bug` are in line with the more traditional meaning of the issue.

Before reporting an issue on the [issue tracker][issues], first, search the already reported issues for similar cases, and if it has been reported already, just add any additional details in the comments.

### Lessons

Issues that capture a new lesson should contain a description of the programming concept being demonstrated. Capture how the concept is useful and a few examples of when it might be leverage in a real-world example.

### Bugs

Please add the label, `bug` to any issues you find with existing lessons. After you made sure that you have found a new issue, here are some tips for creating a helpful report that will make fixing it much easier and quicker:

Write a descriptive, specific title. Bad: Problem with filtering. Good: /api/query always returns an empty graph.
Whenever possible, include Function info in the description.

## Pull Request Process

1. Ensure all build artifacts are ignored from the repository.
2. Commits messages should contain an issue identifier.
3. Only one issue can be addressed in a single pull request.
4. Each issue will be encapsulated in a top-level directory and should contain a README.md file.
5. We'll use :octocat: [CODEOWNERS][owners] to determine who needs to review a pull request.

## Commits

Use a passive voice; i.e. commits should read like ðŸ‘‡  
`If applied this commit will <your actual commit message here>`
